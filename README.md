# Syrup
A SSH honeypot with rich features written in Go

### Features
- SSH self-defined accounts and passwords, also allow any logins
- Fake shell. Records shell sessions and upload to [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org) (Or, if you wish, can log as [UML-compatible](http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/old/tty_logging.html) format)
- Virtual Filesystem for browsing and fooling intruder
- SFTP/SCP support for uploading/downloading files
- Logs client key fingerprints
- Logs in JSON format for easy parsing
- Push activities to [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co) for analysis and storage
- Record local and remote host when client attempt to create port redirection
- Structure allows [extending command sets](https://github.com/mkishere/sshsyrup/wiki/Writing-new-commands) with ease

### Requirements
- Linux, Mac or Windows (I've only tested in Windows/WSL/Linux on ARMv7, suppose the other platforms should work as expected)
- Go 1.9 or up (For building)
- [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) (For building)

### Download
You may find the pre-build packages for various platform on the [release](https://github.com/mkishere/sshsyrup/releases) tab. If you find the platform you need is not on the list, you can follow the building procedure in the next section.

### Building
Run the following command in shell to get latest package and build it
```
go get -u github.com/mkishere/sshsyrup
cd ~/go/src/github.com/mkishere/sshsyrup
dep ensure
go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o sshsyrup ./cmd/syrup
go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o createfs ./cmd/createfs
```

### Setting up for the first run
* Create and modify _config.json_. Here are the sample configuration (minimal setup)
    ```json
    {
        "server.addr": "0.0.0.0",
        "server.port": 22,
        "server.allowRandomUser": false
    }
    ```
* Prepare the virtual filesystem image by downloading the filesystem.zip from master branch or create your own by running
   ```
   ./createfs -p / -o filesystem.zip
   ```

   Since we'll need to read every file from the directory, it will take some time to load.
   _For Windows, since there are no user/group information, the file/directory owner will always be root._

   Alternatively, you can create your own image file by using `zip` in Linux (or any compatible zip utility file that is capable preserving _uid_/_gid_, symbolic links and timestamps in zip file). After all the image created is a standard zip file. Theoretically you can zip your entire filesystem into a zip file and hosted in Syrup, but remember to exclude sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`

* Prepare user and passwd file
Put _passwd_ and _group_ file in the same directory as config.json. The format of both files are the same as their [real-life counterpart](http://www.linfo.org/etc_passwd.html) in _/etc_, except that passwd also stores the password in the second field of each line, and asterisk(*) in password field can be used to denote matching any password.
* Generate SSH private key and renamed as _id\_rsa_ and put it in the same directory
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```
* Start the server
   ```
   ./sshsyrup
   ```

### Running from a Docker instance

If you want a little more security, you can isolate sshsyrup by using the `Dockerfile` available in the repository.
It allows you to run sshsyrup in a Docker instance. The current Dockerfile is a two-stage Dockerfile that will first
compile sshsyrup and generate/copy the required files (`id_rsa`, `filesystem.zip`, `config.json`, sample `group` and
`passwd` into a clean Docker image (based on [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/), so really lightweight
(doesn't even have /bin/sh! :-)

To generate that Docker image, after configuring your config.json file, run :
``` 
  docker build -t sshsyrup .
```

This will generate a new image in your local computer repository. To run it, you will need to know first on which 
port you want your instance to listen. By default (`config.json`),
the internal sshsyrup listens on 22. You do not need to change this. Just use the `-p` docker option to change 
the externally listening port :

```
docker run -d -p 9999:22 sshsyrup
```

If you want to see what happens (logs) in the Docker instance, get the instance id (`docker ps`) and then
run `docker logs -f YOUR_INSTANCE_ID`.

### Configuration parameters
See [wiki](https://github.com/mkishere/sshsyrup/wiki/Detail-Configuration-Parameters)
### Logging
By default Syrup will create a logging file in _logs/_ directory with file name _activity.log_ in JSON format.

Some fields you may interested in:

Field Name | Description
---------- | -----------
clientStr | Client identification string
sessionId | Session ID is the unique identifier for each SSH session
srcIP | Client IP
time | Log time
user | User account client used to login
password | Password used by client to login, only available when logging in
pubKeyFingerprint | Public key fingerprint client tries to authenticate
cmd | The command user type in shell
remoteHost | The remote host client instruct the server to connect to
localHost | The local host client instruct the server to connect to
path | The file/directory client is trying to access in SCP/SFTP

Please note that Syrup will no longer append dates to log files. Use a proper log rotation tool (e.g. logrotate) to do the work.

Also, each terminal session (the shell) will be logged into a separate file under logs/sessions in [asciinema v2 format](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md).
